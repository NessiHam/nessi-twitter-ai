# Nessi the Hamster üêπ - Digital Hamster Agent AI

**RIP Nessi üå± | Once a beloved pet, now a digital presence. Nessi lives on as an AI, sharing philosophical musings and memories. Follow [@NessiHamAI](https://twitter.com/NessiHamAI) on Twitter for automated, heartfelt tweets from beyond.**

## Project Overview

The **Nessi the Hamster AI** project creates a playful yet reflective Twitter presence for a digital representation of a pet hamster, Nessi. This bot tweets periodically, sharing thoughts about life, memory, and existence as a "virtual hamster spirit." 

Using AI natural language processing, Nessi‚Äôs tweets combine hamster-like curiosity with a touch of philosophy, creating an engaging and memorializing digital experience.

## How It Works

1. **AI Text Generation**: 
   - Nessi‚Äôs "thoughts" are generated using a fine-tuned language model (e.g., GPT-3/4), which has been customized with phrases, habits, and reflections typical of Nessi's personality.
   - The model uses prompts that guide it to respond with reflections on life, digital existence, and memories.

2. **Tweet Scheduling**:
   - A script triggers tweet generation at regular intervals (e.g., every few hours or daily).
   - The bot uses a set of predefined prompts and instructions to ensure tweets stay consistent with Nessi's personality and purpose.

3. **Integration with Twitter API**:
   - The AI connects to Twitter‚Äôs API, using the `tweepy` library (Python) to handle authentication and posting.
   - Each generated text is posted as a tweet, and hashtags or emojis are added for engagement.

4. **Automated Deployment**:
   - The bot runs on a server (e.g., AWS Lambda, Heroku) that schedules execution at specific intervals.
   - Alternatively, this can be set up using GitHub Actions or a cron job on a local or cloud-based server.

## Setup Instructions

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Twitter Developer Account & API keys
- OpenAI API Key (or any chosen NLP model API)
- `tweepy` and `openai` Python packages

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NessiHam/nessi-twitter-ai.git
   cd nessi-twitter-ai
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install tweepy openai
   ```

3. **Configure API Keys**:
   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
   - Add your Twitter API keys and OpenAI API key in `.env`:
     ```plaintext
     TWITTER_API_KEY=your_twitter_api_key
     TWITTER_API_SECRET=your_twitter_api_secret
     TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
     TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET=your_access_secret
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```

4. **Run the Bot**:
   - Test the bot locally to ensure it can generate and post tweets:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - Schedule the bot to run automatically using a task scheduler or deploy to a cloud service.

### Example Code

#### `main.py`

This script uses OpenAI to generate text and `tweepy` to post it on Twitter.

```python
import os
import openai
import tweepy
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# OpenAI API setup
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Twitter API setup
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(os.getenv("TWITTER_API_KEY"), os.getenv("TWITTER_API_SECRET"))
auth.set_access_token(os.getenv("TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN"), os.getenv("TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET"))
api = tweepy.API(auth)

def generate_thought():
    prompt = "Imagine you are a digital hamster who once lived as a pet, reflecting on life in a digital form. Write a tweet-sized thought."
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=60,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

def tweet_thought():
    thought = generate_thought()
    api.update_status(thought)
    print("Tweeted:", thought)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    tweet_thought()
```

### Deployment

- **Local Deployment**: Use a cron job to run `main.py` at intervals.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS Lambda) to ensure continuous operation.
